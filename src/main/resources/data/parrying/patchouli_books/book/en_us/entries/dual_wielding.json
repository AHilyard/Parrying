      "text": "Sometimes, one weapon just isn't enough. Fortunately, for times like these, we can use a revolutionary new invention; your other hand! $(br2) Dual wielding techniques generally revolve around balancing a pair of weapons to attack faster. The closer together in speed the weapons are, the faster you will be able to attack. With 2 near-identical weapons, you will be able to attack slightly faster than with just one of them."

      "text": "Weapons cannot be swung at the same time, as this is generally awkward and tends to throw you off balance. To dual wield, simply place a weapon in both hands, and repeatedly attack. The hand you are using will alternate automatically with each swing as long as you are holding both weapons."
